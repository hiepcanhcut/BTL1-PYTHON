1. Number of Groups (K):
   - Based on the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score analysis, K=6 clusters were chosen.
   - The Elbow plot likely showed diminishing returns in WCSS reduction around K=6.
   - The Silhouette Score plot might have indicated a peak or high value at K=6, suggesting reasonable cluster separation.

2. PCA and Clustering Plot:
   - PCA was used to reduce the features to 2 dimensions for visualization.
   - The 2D scatter plot shows the distribution of players based on these two principal components, colored by their assigned K-means cluster.
   - Interpretation of the plot:
     - Observe the separation between clusters. Are they distinct or overlapping?
     - The spread and density of points within each cluster provide insight into the similarity of players grouped together based on the selected statistics.
